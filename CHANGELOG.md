# Changelog

Rate changes themselves are not listed here — they land automatically whenever the
European Commission TEDB publishes them, and every change is visible in the commit
history of [`data/eu-vat-rates-data.json`](https://github.com/vatnode/eu-vat-rates-data-ruby/commits/main/data/eu-vat-rates-data.json).
This file records changes to the package API, the data format, and corrections to
hand-maintained fields.
